Personal repository for my account

## What I am using GitHub for in the first place
I'm using GitHub as a way for me to manage my files for my personal projects, namely game development!
I also hope to contribute to some open source software that I like and hopefully my contributions are appreciated :)

## What I know
I know how to program in C, C++, Python and Java, and I am currently also learning Godot's engine language, GDScript
I am  Software Engineering student with a minor in project management, so I know how to manage the development lifecycle 
using the agile methodology. 

## My Interests

* I am most interested in game development, but all technical fields are facinating to me
* I love playing basketball, reading, creating pixel art and (of course) playing and developing games
